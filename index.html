            <h2 class="section-title">➥ Introduction</h2>
            <div class="note">
                <p>This is a thorough article that includes a lot of information, any important information is colored <strong style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">as RED</strong>.</p>
            </div>
            <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">DODI is a well known game repacker, like Fitgirl, who constantly works on recently released games. He has been uploading since 20XY and is widely known for medium compression level repacks, which drastically reduces install time and system resource usage, and the use of trusted, clean files in all his releases. There is just one problem - his active community is not big, thus most people "hit and run" his repacks without seeding them.  (averagely popular releases get thier seeders dropped to digits like 2 or 5 just one week after thier release) This makes him unreliable on the torrent manner of downloading his repacks, for which he uses certain file-hosters to keep his releases online always. (which is, btw, a huge relaxation for people who live in countries where torrenting is illegal) If you want to download a certain release, and find out that the torrent is dead, you might want to download from those file-hosters which is quite a nasty task to do, since those hosters,by implementing certain unlawful measures like putting ads and popups in thier pages, for thier extra income, (let alone Dodi paying a lot for thier storage) prove a headache for people who aren't experienced. We at Dodi, tirelessly work for free to solve all your issues from downloading till playing, and spent a lot of time making this extensive guide, its purpose, guiding you through the download process, because there is a lot to say about things, which we possibly cannot communicate to you via messages. This guide is designed to help anyone downloading DODI Repacks, and can be used by anyone from a complete begginer to downloading something to a intermediate novice.</span></p>

        <h3>❱❱ Navigating the Correct Site</h3>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The one and only DODI repacks website is:</strong> 
                <a href="https://dodi-repacks.site" style="color: rgb(0, 26, 255);">dodi-repacks.site</a>
            </p>

            </p>
        </div>
    
        <h3>❱❱ Using an Adblocker</h3>
        <p style="color: rgb(193, 0, 0);">
            Now piracy isn't exactly legal, so the filehoster sites used are, of course, less than legit. The ads there often contain malware 
            (this is the case for almost all piracy sites), so you must have an adblocker. 
            The in-built AdBlockers that come with browsers like Edge/Brave/Opera/Opera GX are NOT STRONG ENOUGH.
            You must either download LibreWolf (based on Firefox and comes with uBlock Origin by default) or get uBlock Origin Lite 
            (non-lite only works on Firefox) if you don't want to switch.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong style="color: lime;">HIGHLY RECOMMENDED:</strong> 
                <a href="https://librewolf.net/installation/" style="color: rgb(23, 2, 255);">LibreWolf</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong style="color: lime;">uBlock Origin:</strong> Just get it from the Chrome web store or wherever you get extensions from. 
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong style="color: lime;">Adguard Browser Extension:</strong> This is also a good option.
                If you don't know how to install extensions, just Google "how to download extensions (your browser)".

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> All the instructions below assume you are using LibreWolf or have an adblocker enabled.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> If uBlock warns you about a site, that site is likely bad. Go back and try the link again.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>❱❱ <span style="color: magenta;">Torrent</span></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Torrenting is the most convenient way to get your games, but it does have some caveats.</li>
                <li>If you are in Argentina, the US, Canada, UK, UAE, Korea, Italy, France, Japan, Spain, Netherlands, Mexico, Turkey, New Zealand, or Australia, you need a VPN for torrenting. If not, you don't need one. ProtonVPN premium is highly recommended for its port forwarding feature.</li>
                <li><span style="color: orange;"><strong>If you want to know how torrenting works:</strong></span> <a href="https://majesty.lol/post/introduction-to-torrents"><strong>Queen's Guide to Torrents</strong></a></li>
                <li>Download a BitTorrent client, preferably <a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/download">qBittorrent</a>.<strong style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> Avoid uTorrent or BitTorrent as they have had malware issues.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Steps to set up qBittorrent:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Enable your VPN, go to settings, and adjust connection and advanced settings as outlined in this guide.</li>
                <li>Set your VPN to use Wireguard UDP for the best speed.</li>
                <li>Find your desired game and torrent it. If links are down, try <a href="https://1337x.to">1337X.to</a>,<strong style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">ensuring DODI is the uploader.</strong> </li>

            <h3>❱❱ <span style="color: magenta;">Multi-Hosts (500 MB | 2GB | 10GB Links)</span></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Always use a download manager like <a href="https://jdownloader.org/download/index">JDownloader 2</a> for faster downloads.</li>
                <li>Ensure files are downloaded in the correct order without renaming them.</li>

                        <li>Sites that show <code>Invalid Now</code> will not have the file as it might get removed due to copyright. Click on the <code>Download</code> button on the ones that show <code>Valid Now</code>.</li>
                        <li>Most sites have a cooldown before the next download, so it's kind of annoying. In such cases, switch to torrenting.</li>

                        <li>Scroll down and click <code>Regular Download</code>. Most of the time, it won't redirect to a malicious site. If it does, Ublock closes the popup immediately. After you're on a new link, it may redirect again, so ignore or close the popup.</li>

            If you have done a DDL, download 
            <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html" style="color: #1500ff;">7-ZIP</a>, select all parts, 
            and use 7Z to extract them. (On Windows 11, you'll have to click "More Options" to find 7Z.) 
            Once they're done, open the folder and run the setup. 
            <strong>It is not recommended to delete the parts until the game is verified to work.</strong>

        <h2 class="section-title">➥ Fixing Common Errors</h2>
        <p>It is common to encounter various errors and problems during/after installation of DODI Repacks. Here are some common fixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Install to games, NOT Program Files (x86).</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Turn off antivirus during setup.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Add an exclusion to the directory where you normally install your games (e.g., C:\Games).</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Un-select the "DirectX 9.0c" option unless it's your first time.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Prefer installing onto a shorter path.</strong></li>
        </ul>

            This is a small list of common fixes, and your issue might not be solved by these steps.

        <p>
            If you downloaded a "setup.exe," likely from Mega, and it was password-protected, way too small to fit the game, 
            and didn’t do anything when run, then you have likely run malware. 
            Go to <a href="https://rentry.org/XTXs-malware-removal-guide" style="color: #001eff;">The XTX Guy's malware removal guide</a>.
