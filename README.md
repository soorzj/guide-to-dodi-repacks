# SOORZJ & The XTX Guy's Guide to DODI Repacks

## The Guide : [soorzj.github.io/guide-to-dodi-repacks](https://soorzj.github.io/guide-to-dodi-repacks/)

## Info
DODI is a well known game repacker, like Fitgirl, who constantly works on recently released games. He has been uploading since 2018 and is widely known for medium compression level repacks, which drastically reduces install time and system resource usage, and the use of trusted, clean files in all his releases. There is just one problem - his active community is not big, thus most people "hit and run" his repacks without seeding them.  (averagely popular releases get thier seeders dropped to digits like 2 or 5 just one week after thier release) This makes him unreliable on the torrent manner of downloading his repacks, for which he uses certain file-hosters to keep his releases online always. (which is, btw, a huge relaxation for people who live in countries where torrenting is illegal) If you want to download a certain release, and find out that the torrent is dead, you might want to download from those file-hosters which is quite a nasty task to do, since those hosters,by implementing certain unlawful measures like putting ads and popups in thier pages, for thier extra income, (let alone Dodi paying a lot for thier storage) prove a headache for people who aren't experienced. We at Dodi, tirelessly work for free to solve all your issues from downloading till playing, and spent a lot of time making this extensive guide, its purpose, guiding you through the download process, because there is a lot to say about things, which we possibly cannot communicate to you via messages. This guide is designed to help anyone downloading DODI Repacks, and can be used by anyone from a complete begginer to downloading something to a intermediate novice.
